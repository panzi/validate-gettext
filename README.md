Validate Gettext
================

A very simple gettext validator for C/C++/Objective-C. I wrote this in a couple
of hours on two days.

Example output:

Note
----

This tries to only match calls to the global `_()` function. It can distinguish
between `_()`, `::_()`, `foo._()`, `foo->_()`, and `foo::_()` and will only
match the first two. However, it cannot detect if `_` is a local variable or a
member, because that would require a full blown C++ parser.

This doesn't correctly parse parameters that use C++ templates with multiple
template parameters. See:

    _("foo bar baz", std::pair<int, int>(1, 2), 123)
      ^- 1st arg     ^- 2nd arg     ^- 3rd arg  ^- 4th arg

However, if its enclosed in paranthesis it works:

    _("foo bar baz", (std::pair<int, int>(1, 2)), 123)
      ^- 1st arg     ^- 2nd arg                   ^- 3rd arg

A C++ parser would need to have type informations in order to even _parse_ such
code correctly. I won't write a full blown C++ parser. And for this particular
use we only need to parse the first argument and only if it is a string literal.

TODO
----

Support digraphs. Won't ever support trigraphs.

Support C++ custom literals. Currently they are parsed as a string/number
literal followed by an identifier, which is probably good enough for this?
